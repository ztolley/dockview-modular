# Dockvew Modular

A POC web application that renders Web Components in Dockview panels.

The initial iteration simply renders a few example web components to get the Dockview infrastructure in place.

The second iteration will add the plugin discovery logic that will analyse npm depdendencies and find those that conform to a protocol to describe a dockview panel web component and include it in the build and offer it as an option to display.
